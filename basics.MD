- Sequence of bytes of data with state
- Sequence of events over time

## Pipeline

- unidirectional channel of communication between processes in OS via buffering
- a pipe is a connection between two processes, such that the standard output from one process becomes the standard input of the other process. In UNIX Operating System, Pipes are useful for communication between related processes(inter-process communication).
- Pipes behave FIFO(First in First out), Pipe behave like a queue data structure.

## Events

- In programming, an event is an action that occurs as a result of the user or another source, such as a mouse being clicked, or a key being pressed. An event handler is a routine that is used to deal with the event, allowing a programmer to write code that will be executed when the event occurs.
- Serverless is taking event driven programming to the next level.

## Process
- A process is simply a program in execution

## Signals

- A signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process or to a specific thread within the same process in order to notify it of an event that occurred. Signals originated in 1970s Bell Labs Unix and have been more recently specified in the POSIX standard.
